U-Boot is the most popular bootloader for embedded Linux systems. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the complete process of configuring and building U-Boot for your target board.

## Introduction

Before we dive into the hands-on section, let's understand what U-Boot does and why it's essential for embedded systems.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
- Linux development environment
- Cross-compilation toolchain
- Target board documentation
- Serial console access

## Building U-Boot from Source

Here's a complete walkthrough of building U-Boot:

<YouTube id="example-build-video" title="Building U-Boot Step by Step" />

### Key Commands

After watching the video, here are the commands we used:

```bash
# Clone U-Boot repository
git clone https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot.git
cd u-boot

# Configure for your board
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- am335x_evm_defconfig

# Customize configuration
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig

# Build
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j$(nproc)
```

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced features like network boot, skip to the relevant section:

The video above starts at the 2-minute mark where we cover network configuration.

## Environment Variables

U-Boot environment variables are crucial for boot configuration. Watch this explanation:

<YouTube id="env-vars-video" title="U-Boot Environment Variables" />

**Common environment variables:**
- `bootcmd` - Command to boot the kernel
- `bootargs` - Kernel command line arguments
- `ipaddr` - Device IP address
- `serverip` - TFTP server IP

## Device Tree Integration

Understanding device trees is essential for modern U-Boot:
