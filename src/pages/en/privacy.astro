    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Essential Data (Required)</h3>
    <p>We store the following data locally in your browser (localStorage):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Theme preferences</strong> - Your choice of light or dark mode</li>
      <li><strong>Cookie consent preferences</strong> - Your choices regarding cookies and tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored only in your browser and is never transmitted to our servers.
      It is necessary for basic website functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics Data (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
      If you consent to analytics cookies, we may collect anonymized usage data to help us understand
      how visitors use our site and improve our content. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages visited</li>

      <li>Referring pages</li>

    <h3>YouTube Embedded Content (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
      Our blog posts may include embedded YouTube videos. If you consent to YouTube cookies,
      these videos will be loaded from YouTube servers. When you play a video, YouTube:
    </p>

      <li>Will receive your IP address</li>
      <li>May set cookies to track viewing behavior</li>
      <li>May use this data according to their own privacy policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use YouTube's privacy-enhanced mode (youtube-nocookie.com) to minimize tracking,
      but some data collection by YouTube may still occur when you play videos.
