    <p>
      This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you visit our website.
      We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller responsible for your personal data is Fabbio Protopapa, the owner of this blog.
      For privacy inquiries, please contact us using the information provided at the bottom of this page.
    </p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Essential Data (Required)</h3>
    <p>We store the following data locally in your browser (localStorage):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cookie consent preferences</strong> - Your choices regarding cookies and tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored only in your browser and is never transmitted to our servers.
      It is necessary for basic website functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>Preferences (Optional)</h3>
    <p>We store the following preference data locally in your browser (localStorage):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Theme preferences</strong> - Your choice of light or dark mode</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored only in your browser and is never transmitted to our servers.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics Data (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
      If you consent to analytics, we collect anonymized usage data using a self-hosted instance
      of <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umami</a> analytics
      at <code>prov.tuxownia.pl</code>. Umami is a privacy-respecting analytics tool:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No cookies</strong> - Umami does not use any cookies</li>
      <li><strong>IP addresses are hashed</strong> - Your IP address is hashed and never stored in plain text</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking</strong> - It is not possible to track visitors across third-party websites or identify individual users</li>
      <li><strong>Data is anonymous</strong> - All collected data is fully anonymized</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only aggregated statistics are collected, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages visited</li>
      <li>Referring pages</li>
      <li>Browser type and device information</li>
      <li>Approximate geographic location (country/region and city level)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Server Access Logs</h3>
    <p>
      Our server automatically records access logs for security and diagnostic purposes.
      These logs are fully anonymized - IP addresses are truncated, making it impossible to identify individual users.
      Anonymized logs are used solely for security monitoring and troubleshooting technical issues.
    </p>

    <h3>YouTube Embedded Content (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
      Our blog posts may include embedded YouTube videos. If you consent to YouTube cookies,
      these videos will be loaded from YouTube servers. When you play a video, YouTube:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will receive your IP address</li>
      <li>May set cookies to track viewing behavior</li>
      <li>May use this data according to their own privacy policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use YouTube's privacy-enhanced mode (youtube-nocookie.com) to minimize tracking,
      but some data collection by YouTube may still occur when you play videos.
