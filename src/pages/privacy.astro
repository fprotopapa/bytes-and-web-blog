    <h3>YouTube Embedded Content (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
      Our blog posts may contain embedded videos from YouTube. If you consent to YouTube cookies,

    <p>
      We use YouTube's privacy-enhanced mode (youtube-nocookie.com) to minimize tracking,
      but some data collection by YouTube may still occur when videos are played.
